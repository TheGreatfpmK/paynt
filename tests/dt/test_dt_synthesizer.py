        Regression coverage for the multi-constraint AR splitting gap (paper https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/16593 Section 3.3): unlike
        test_split_undecided_space_survives_a_multi_property_specification above (one trivially-true
        constraint alongside optimality, which resolves before ever reaching split_undecided_space's new
        L(h)/undecided_results() logic in any interesting way), this specification has TWO real constraints
        and NO optimality objective, forcing split_undecided_space to actually run its new
        compute_incompatibility_levels/undecided_results() code paths repeatedly.

        dt-orchard's only event is "goal", so two P>=x[F "goal"] constraints at different thresholds don't
        produce genuine cross-constraint disagreement (both push toward the same underlying policy) -- this
        model can't exercise the L(h) tier specifically (that needs constraints on genuinely different
        criteria, like easy.props's two different reward structures in
        tests/synthesizer/test_synthesizer_ar.py). What it does confirm: neither harmonize_inconsistent_
        scheduler nor split_undecided_space crashes or hangs when node.analysis_result.constraints_result has
        2 undecided entries, and the search genuinely explores (unlike a trivially-resolved-at-the-root spec).
        Bounded rather than run to completion -- this threshold has no admissible tree within a few seconds
        on this model, confirmed manually, and this test only cares about "does not crash", not convergence.
